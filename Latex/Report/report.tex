\hspace*{1in} I joined The Laxmi Niwas Mittal Institute of Information Technology in 2011 for my Graduation. I am currently a first year B.tech student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).\vspace{.5in}\\
\hspace*{1in} In this report known as "Semester Diary" I kept the record of all the activities I did in my first semester. It includes the Academic courses I did,events in which I participated and other happenings that took place in our campus.

 IEEE as a society is more popular for the volunteerism opportunities it provides to every individual member starting from the student member grade to fellow grade. 
\emph{I also volunteered for the IEEE workshop organised by W3C India on HTML 5}
